        <h1>Good vs Bad Design</h1>
        <h2>As told by Dina Williams</h2>
        <h3>Netflix iPhone App</h3>
        <img src="netflix.jpg" alt="Netlfix App Homepage" class="netflix">
        <p>Dina likes the Netflix app designed for the iPhone because it is fast and portable, something that she can't get on her computer. On her phone, watching Netlfix at night before bed is convenient because it is smaller than a laptop. The app remembers your login information and profile so that you do not have to select your profile every time you use it, as you do on the webpage. It is convenient to have the app on your phone because it is able to send you notifications when a new season of a show you previously watched is released or when it identifies movies it thinks you may like. Using the app is "an experience," made apparent by things such as the design of the logo when the app is opened, how it fades in to view and takes up the whole screen while it loads. You are able to watch trailers for TV shows and movies on the home page by clicking on circular icons in a row at the top of the screen, similar to features on apps such as Snapchat or Instagram. Overall, the Netflix app provides a convenient and engaging user experience.</p>
        <h4>Kerrey Hall Sinks</h4>
        <img src="sink.jpg" alt="Kerrey Hall Bathroom Sink" class="sink">
        <p>The sinks in Kerrey Hall's bathrooms are poorly designed due to their shape and size. They are flat, wide, and shallow so that when the water is turned on, it spalshes straight out of the sink. The faucet sits far back along the sink so that it is diffcult to even fit your hands underneath it, let alone avoid spalshing the water out of the bowl. This becomes a problem because it creates a mess. Also, it is necessary to clean the sink and the surrounding area constantly so that no mold forms. Dina says that she has even started to brush her teeth at the kitchen sink, because the bathroom sink is just that annoying. The bathroom sink's poor design is an example of how an everyday object should be well-design because it is in the best interest and comfort of the user.</p>
