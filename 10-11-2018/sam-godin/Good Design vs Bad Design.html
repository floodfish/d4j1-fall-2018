		<h1>Good Design - Measuring Cup With Top View Measurements</h1>
	<img src="measuring.jpg">
	<p>This measuring cup has measurements on a slanted surface so that you are able to see what you’re pouring from above. You don’t have to get down to the tables level to look at the amount in the cup. You can pour into the measuring cup and see when to stop as opposed to pouring and checking, hoping you added the right amount. It’s an attractive shape. The cup is equipped with a rubber grip handle. It still has original measure lines as well.</p>
		<h1>Bad Design - To Go Thermos for Pouring Liquid</h1>
	<img src="thermos.jpg">
	<p>A thermos is usually created for bringing liquid with you on the go.  This thermos has a top that you are not intended to drink out of. Instead, you are supposed to pour liquid into a removable cup. Some of these thermos’ can brew tea in them, however tea shouldn’t steep for that long, and in a to go container it is hard to regulate the amount of time the tea will steep for. Making an item that people purchase to be able to use on the go, that you can’t use without a cup makes no sense</p>
