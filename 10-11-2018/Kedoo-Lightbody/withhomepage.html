"It is really unsafe and distracting rather than traditional buttons. Touch screen you have to look at the screen while driving," says Ellie Plass </p>
<p> How often do you use car dashboards?- "In High school when driving to school, and going out with friends." </p>
<p> Is there a potential threat? "Distracted driving is almost as bad as drunk driving. Phones have caused a lot of deaths and the dashboard screen isn't that far away from the phone."" </p>

<p> What is the mental difference between traditional and the whole screen dashboard? "Touch screen is more of a focus rather than the traditional. The traditional has buttons, which you can feel for while driving."</p>

 <p> How could it be better- Improvement of the steering wheel. When you are driving you dont even have to take your hands off of the steering wheel; you can just control the multimedia and the car system. </p>

	

	<p>According to NPR, "The touch screen systems in new vehicles are distracting, increasing the risk of accidents. That's according to a new study from the University of Utah. Researchers say all 30 systems they tested cause some level of driver distraction. A prominent safety advocate says automakers can make their systems safer by preventing drivers from using certain features when the car is moving."
