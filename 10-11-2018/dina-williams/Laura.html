<h1> Laura Hunter on Good vs Bad Design: The Netflix Web Page vs. Garment Racks  </h1>

<h2> By Dina Williams </h2>

<h3> September 29, 2018 </h3>


<p> Interning for various fashion houses, Laura has had great experience on the production side of fashion. She exposed daily to great design and ideas. However the very object that these garments are being hung onto are, according to Laura, of the poorest design. It’s sad to see that even garment racks at major fashion houses are designed poorly. </p>

<p>Garment racks come in all sorts of colors and sizes but generally have a similar structure consisting of two parallel rods with a top and bottom rod joining them together. The photo above depicts a garment rack just like the one Laura has to deal with at work. It may appear typical and familiar but it holds a plethora of design fails. </p>

<p>According to Laura, the rack is hard to assemble by yourself. This is because the two parallel rods on the left and right do not support themselves enough to allow the user time to apply the top rod and bridge them together. If you are like Laura and are able to get passed that step you will find the next design fail, the wheels. The wheels on the rack are not best quality and constantly get stuck. </p>

<p>At the end of the day when it is time for Laura to break down the garment rack, the final design fail is revealed. The garment rack is not compact when it is broken down, further making it difficult to store.</p>

<p> Laura, in her freetime, enjoys watching netflix. And this is not solely because of the content but also the experience. She enjoys the website form of Netflix because of its design and functionality. Laura, in general, prefers to use her computer over her phone because she prefers a bigger screen and the functions on the computer. So she likes the layout of the web version. 


<p>Her favorite part of the web version is the huge spread they have on the top for a new and highly anticipated movie/tv show. In that spread it also gives her the option to add it to her watchlist. And it usually plays automatically plays trailer as the spread. Laura also likes that when she hovers over a show she has started, it shows her how far she is in the episode as well as the season and episode she is on. Another great feature is that it automatically loads the next episode. Laura is also a fan of the percent match feature that allows the user to see how compatible they are with a show based on previous watch history. </p>
