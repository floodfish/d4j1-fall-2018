    <p> "Fanny packs are a great invention!" said Eden, "They are practical, functional, and they often can carry more than you think. They can be worn in different ways, they can be fashionable, they can be weatherproof, they're small and compact, light, durable, and they're hands-free! They're also adjustable and one size fits all... Nothing better than that.</p>

    <p> "Running shoes are good design because they're made to support your posture, spine and running ability. They are always extremely comfortable and easy to walk or run in!"

    <p> "Mops are poorly designed because I feel like they're an anti-cleaning design. Nothing ever becomes clean with them. I'm really surprised that they haven't incorporated a broom, vacuum, and mop into one device rather than separate. That being said, you could argue that a broom is well-designed because it's timeless!"</li></p>

    <p> "Stove-top kettles are so poorly designed because when the whole kettle heats up, it's too hot to even hold the thing without burning yourself when the entire purpose is to heat up water with it, so it doesn't make any sense."</li></p>
