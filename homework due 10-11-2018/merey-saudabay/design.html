  <h2>Good Design: Short Candle</h2>

  <p>According to Liz White, a senior in the Journalism & Design program at The New School, a short candle is an example of good design because it is “easy to use” and allows for greater accessibility when going to light the candle.</p>
  <p>Though she admitted that the short candle she has at home is “uglier” than her taller candle, and perhaps not as long lasting, she never has to struggle with trying to light it.</p>
  <p>Liz also enjoys the scent, which she described as “midnight something.” Liz prefers to purchase short candles that already come in a glass jars, as opposed to candles without containers. </p>

  <h2>Bad Design: Tall Candle</h2>

  <p>A tall candle, according to Liz, is “really frustrating.” She cites a tall candle as an example of poor design because the more she uses the candle, the more it melts, and the more it melts, the more it shrinks into its glass jar, and the more it shrinks into its glass jar, the harder it becomes to light the candle in the first place.</p>
  <p>Liz has burnt herself one too many times trying to light her taller candle that now she no longer uses it. “I haven’t lit it in so long that I don’t even know what it smells like anymore. I still keep it on my table because I don’t want it to go to waste – I don’t want to just throw it away,” she said.</p>
  <p>Though Liz acknowledges that “it’s better looking” than her shorter candle, with its vivid green shade, she dislikes the fact that she would need a longer lighter to use it and not her standard short Bic lighter.</p>
