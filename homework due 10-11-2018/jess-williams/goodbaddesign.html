		<p>NEW YORK, NY - On Thursday afternoon, I had the pleasure of sitting down
    with New School University student, Aja Simpson, to discuss two objects that
    resonated with her. One object she admired because of it's impeccable and
    extremely thoughtful, innovative construction and design. The other object,
    however, she despised because of faux usefulness and flawed design.</p>

      <div id="caption"><i>The Santa Fe Opera House at night. The unique structure
      sits in the middle of the New Mexican desert with nothing but the barren
      landscape and the mountains behind it -- oh, and the Tesuque Casino next door.</i></div>

		<p>For starters, Santa Fe, New Mexico is home to one of the most renowned and
    beautiful opera houses in the world. The Santa Fe Opera House, is an impeccably
    designed building that features elements that are unique to the opera house.
    Aja cited that her number one favorite thing about the opera house was its
    beautiful location. The opera house, placed on the outskirts of Santa Fe's city
    center, stands alone in the New Mexican desert with the mountains in the
    background. "From far away it looks really cool, yet obscure" Simpson stated.</p>

		<p>The curvature of the roof of the opera house was a deliberate design decision
    so that the sound would travel farther, allowing the upper mezzanine to hear the
    opera without any issues. "There's no microphone usage at the opera house for
    that reason" says Aja. The roof curvurture also prevents any sort of possible sound
    obstruction from the outdoor elements, including rain, wind and thunderstorms.</p>

		<p>The Santa Fe Opera House is a seasonal performance space, meaning that it
    is only open for performances during the summer months. However, the summer
    months, specifically July and August, are monsoon season in Santa Fe. Seeing
    as there are no side walls to the venue, the building designers thoughtfully
    allotted extra space for the roof to extend over the seats on the outskirts
    of the venue. However, Aja noted that sometimes the rain can be unpredictable
    and could possibly blow in a direction that would cause patrons in the far
    seats to get wet.</p>

    <p> What is perhaps the most amazing feature of this opera house is also one of
      the smallest. Desingers of the opera house came to a realization that the
      majority of opera's that are performed at the opera house are in foreign languages.
      So, the opera house is equipped with a bar in front of each seat that translates
      the opera in real time. This system is called the Labretto System. And you
      might be skeptical that real time really means <i>real time,</i> but
      Aja explained that there are employees whose jobs it is to sit in a room and
      actively translate the opera as it is going on, so as to prevent any translation
      lagging. </p>

    <p> Opera house designers also added multiple elements to help with the absorbtion
      of sound throughout the performance space. Aja details that "there’s an
      infinity pool at the Opera House, in between the orchestra pit and the
      first row of seats...so that the water can absorb some of the echoing from the sound"
      And on the open sides of the opera house, wind baffles were installed to
      help absord ehoing.</p>

    <p> You can watch this short YouTube video below to get a full view of how
      beautiful and impeccably designed the Santa Fe Opera House is.</p>

		<p>Now, in order to delve into the next - and completely unrelated - topic,
    allow me to offer some background information to help you further understand
    why this poorly designed object is disliked so strongly by Aja. Born in Santa Fe,
    New Mexico, Aja attended the University of New Mexico for her first two years
    of university. Aja discussed that the City of Albuquerque, where her university
    was located, was not the safest city. She mentioned the cities high rate of crime
    and that some city patrons would go to extreme ends to steal bikes and bike parts.
    So it's no wonder that Aja feels so strongly about this unique, but less than
    effective bike rack from Dero.</p>

		<p>"It’s dumb because I've tried to use one of them before, and it only works
    for one bike." Aja says. The reason that it only works for one bike, is
    because you have three areas where you can lock your bike and those locations
    are the exact locations you need to lock your bike up in order to securely
    fasten your bike properly: the front and back wheels as well as the main seat.</p>

      <div id="caption"><i>A man ties his bike to a Dero bike rack on the sidewalk.</i></div>

		<p>What is perhaps the most flawed element of this design is the Dero bike rack's
    functionality in large major cities. When bike racks like this are the only
    type of bike rack on a college campus, it can be a challenge because there is
    a high volume of bikes and not enough space on the bike rack. This causes students
    to leave their bikes unlocked, unprotected and alone in an effort to make it
    to class on time - thus causing a higher presence of stolen and lost bikes.</p>

		<p>Another big reason the Dero bike rack is not functional, is that bikes comes
    in a diverse range of shapes and sizes. It can be very hard to find a bike
    that would fit perfectly to the Dero bike rack frame, and what do you do when
    your bike doesn't fit against the bike rack properly causing your U-Lock to
    not lock properly.</p>

		<p>Don't get me wrong, Aja is a fan of the concept behind the design of the
    Dero bike rack. "It’s kind of cool to look at." she says. A lot of articles
    online describe the bike rack as a “purposeful” art piece.</p>

      <div id="caption"><i>A family waits for their bus next to a Dero bike rack.
      While it might seem popular and functional in smaller cities like this, it
      is important to note that there is only one bike attached to the bike rack.</i></div>

		<p>And lastly, the sheer size of the bike rack is not practical in most cities.
    The length of the bike rack is approx 5 feet long, which is a lot in cities like
    New York, where the sidewalk space is already limited and there is not nearly
    enough room to add these oversized, impractical bike racks.</p>
